# LogisimHexDisplay
A working hex display based off of combinations of binary code, created using logic gates. In order to assemble the combination of logic gates needed to make the hex display work, I had to derive Boolean equations from truth tables, reduce those equations using Karnaugh maps, and then assign the appropriate logic gate for each equation.
