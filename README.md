# LogisimHexDisplay
A working hex display based on combinations of binary code, created using logic gates. In order to assemble the combination of logic gates needed to make the hex display work, I had to derive Boolean equations from truth tables, reduce those equations using Karnaugh maps, and then assign the appropriate logic gate for each equation. More information regarding this project and the steps taken can be found in the .pdf file located inside the repository.
